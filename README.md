## Project setup

### Run the Bird Tracker Client (Front End)

For this project, you have been given a client web app. Open the `vue` folder in Visual Studio Code and check out the README for more details on running the client.

### Database

Inside the `database/` directory, you'll find an executable Bash script (`.sh` file) and several SQL scripts (`.sql` files). These can be used to build and rebuild a PostgreSQL database for the capstone project.

From a terminal session, execute the following commands:

```
cd <project-root>/database/
./create.sh
```

This Bash script drops the existing database, if necessary, creates a new database named `bird_db`, and runs the various SQL scripts in the correct order. You shouldn't need to modify the Bash script.
